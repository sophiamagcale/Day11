    "The book I am reading is Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil. I borrowed the book from the ones you offered to the class, but I was interested in this one in particular just because I like doing math. I've read the first three chapters and the general message so far is that mathematical models/data science can actually have a massive negative impact on society. The first chapter uses baseball as an example to show how data is used to create models that can predict the outcomes of various situations, and how this is used to help teams win the World Series. Further, the film Moneyball is centered around this practice of mathematical modeling and it was interesting because I have watched the film myself. The third chapter goes into how the U.S. News created a ranking system to rank colleges based on proxy data, and how this creates feedback loops that negatively impact colleges and students. I was really interested in this and I want to explain this specific example to my family since my younger sister still has to plan for college, and I want them to understand the reality of college admissions and how data plays a big role in it."
